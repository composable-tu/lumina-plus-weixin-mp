The plugin exposes TypeScript's compiler options to gulp using TypeScript API.\n\nThis plugin works best with gulp 4. If you cannot update to this version, please see the section \"Gulp 3\" below.\n\nUpdating from version 2? See the [breaking changes in version 3](http://dev.ivogabe.com/gulp-typescript-3/).\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ivogabe/gulp-typescript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ivogabe/gulp-typescript)\n\nHow to install\n--------------\n##### 1. Install gulp CLI\n```shell\nnpm install --global gulp-cli\n```\n##### 2. Install gulp in the project dependency\n```shell\nnpm install gulp@4\n```\n##### 3. Install gulp-typescript & TypeScript\n```shell\nnpm install gulp-typescript typescript\n```\n\nOptions\n-------\nAlmost all options from TypeScript are supported.\n- `outFile` (string) - Generate one javascript and one definition file. Only works when no module system is used.\n- `outDir` (string) - Move output to a different (virtual) directory. Note that you still need `gulp.dest` to write output to disk.\n- `noImplicitAny` (boolean) - Warn on expressions and declarations with an implied 'any' type.\n- `suppressImplicitAnyIndexErrors` (boolean) - Suppress `--noImplicitAny` errors for indexing objects lacking index signatures.\n- `noLib` (boolean) - Don't include the default lib (with definitions for - Array, Date etc)\n- `lib` (string[]) - List of library files to be included in the compilation.\n- `target` (string) - Specify ECMAScript target version: 'ES3' (default), 'ES5' or 'ES6'.\n- `module` (string) - Specify module code generation: 'commonjs', 'amd', 'umd' or 'system'.\n- `jsx` (string) - Specify jsx code generation: 'react' or 'preserve' (TS1.6+).\n- `declaration` (boolean) - Generates corresponding .d.ts files. You need to pipe the `dts` streams to save these files.\n- `removeComments` (boolean) - Do not emit comments to output.\n- `emitDecoratorMetadata` (boolean) - Emit design-time metadate for decorated declarations in source.\n- `experimentalAsyncFunctions` (boolean) - Support for ES7-proposed asynchronous functions using the `async`/`await` keywords (TS1.6+).\n- `experimentalDecorators` (boolean) - Enables experimental support for ES7 decorators.\n- `moduleResolution` (string) - Determine how modules get resolved. Either 'node' for Node.js/io.js style resolution, or 'classic' (default) (TS1.6+).\n- `noEmitOnError` (boolean) - Do not emit outputs if any type checking errors were reported.\n- `noEmitHelpers` (boolean) - Do not generate custom helper functions like __extends in compiled output.\n- `preserveConstEnums` (boolean) - Do not erase const enum declarations in generated code. \n- `isolatedModules` (boolean) - Compiles files seperately and doesn't check types, which causes a big speed increase. You have to use gulp-plumber and TypeScript 1.5+.\n- `allowJs` (boolean) - Allow JavaScript files to be compiled.\n- `rootDir` - Specifies the root directory of input files. Only use to control the output directory structure with `outDir`.\n\nSee the [TypeScript wiki](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) for a complete list.\nThese options are not supported:\n- Sourcemap options (`sourceMap`, `inlineSourceMap`, `inlineSources`, `sourceRoot`, `declarationMap`) - Use  [gulp-sourcemaps](https://github.com/floridoo/gulp-sourcemaps) instead.\n- `watch` - Use `gulp.watch` instead. See the paragraph \"Incremental compilation\".\n- `project` - See \"Using `tsconfig.json`\".\n- Obvious: `help`, `version`\n\nAPI overview\n------------\ngulp-typescript can be imported using `const ts = require('gulp-typescript');`. It provides the following functions:\n\n- `ts(options?)` - Returns a gulp stream that compiles TypeScript files using the specified options.\n- `ts.createProject(options?)`, `ts.createProject(tsconfig filename, options?)` - Returns a project. The intended usage is to create a project outside of a task with `const tsProject = ts.createProject(..);`. Within a task, `tsProject()` can be used to compile a stream of TypeScript files.\n- `tsProject.src()` - Returns a stream containing the source files (.ts) from a tsconfig file. It can only be used if you create a project with a `tsconfig.json` file. It is a replacement for `gulp.src(..)`.\n\nBoth `ts(..)` and `tsProject()` provide sub-streams that only contain the JavaScript or declaration files. An example is shown later in the readme.\n\nBasic Usage\n----------\nBelow is a minimal `gulpfile.js` which will compile all TypeScript file in folder `src` and emit a single output file called `output.js` in  `built/local`. To invoke, simple run `gulp`.\n\n```javascript\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\nvar ts = require('gulp-typescript');\n\ngulp.task('default', function () {\n    return gulp.src('src/**/*.ts')\n        .pipe(ts({\n            noImplicitAny: true,\n            outFile: 'output.js'\n        }))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest('built/local'));\n});\n```\nAnother example of `gulpfile.js`. Instead of creating the default task, the file specifies custom named task. To invoke, run `gulp scripts` instead of `gulp`. As a result, the task will generate both JavaScript files and TypeScript definition files (`.d.ts`).\n```javascript\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\nvar ts = require('gulp-typescript');\nvar merge = require('merge2');  // Requires separate installation\n\ngulp.task('scripts', function() {\n    var tsResult = gulp.src('lib/**/*.ts')\n        .pipe(ts({\n            declaration: true\n        }));\n\n    return merge([\n        tsResult.dts.pipe(gulp.dest('release/definitions')),\n        tsResult.js.pipe(gulp.dest('release/js'))\n    ]);\n});\n```\n`tsResult` is a stream containing the generated JavaScript and definition files.\nIn many situations, some plugins need to be executed on the JavaScript files.\nFor these situations, the stream has sub-streams, namely a JavaScript stream (`tsResult.js`) and a definition file stream (`tsResult.dts`). \nYou need to set the `declaration` option to generate definition files.\nIf you don't need the definition files, you can use a configuration as seen in the first example, and you don't need to store the result into a variable as `tsResult`.\n\nIncremental compilation\n-----------------------\nInstead of calling `ts(options)`, you can create a project first outside of the task. Inside the task, you should then use `tsProject()`. An example:\n```javascript\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\nvar ts = require('gulp-typescript');\nvar merge = require('merge2');\n\nvar tsProject = ts.createProject({\n    declaration: true\n});\n\ngulp.task('scripts', function() {\n    return gulp.src('lib/*.ts')\n        .pipe(tsProject())\n        .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));\n});\n\ngulp.task('watch', ['scripts'], function() {\n    gulp.watch('lib/*.ts', ['scripts']);\n});\n```\nWhen you run `gulp watch`, the source will be compiled as usual. Then, when you make a change and save the file, your TypeScript files will be compiled in about half the time.\n\nYou must create the project outside of the task. You can't use the same project in multiple tasks.\nInstead, create multiple projects or use a single task to compile your sources. Usually it is not worth to create different tasks for the client side, backend or tests.\n\nUsing `tsconfig.json`\n-------------\nTo use `tsconfig.json`, you have to use `ts.createProject`:\n```javascript\nvar tsProject = ts.createProject('tsconfig.json');\n```\nIf you want to add or overwrite certain settings in the `tsconfig.json` file, you can use:\n```javascript\nvar tsProject = ts.createProject('tsconfig.json', { noImplicitAny: true });\n```\nThe task will look like:\n```javascript\ngulp.task('scripts', function() {\n    var tsResult = gulp.src(\"lib/**/*.ts\") // or tsProject.src()\n        .pipe(tsProject());\n\n    return tsResult.js.pipe(gulp.dest('release'));\n});\n```\n\nYou can replace `gulp.src(...)` with `tsProject.src()` to load files based on the tsconfig file (based on `files`, `excludes` and `includes`).\n\nTypeScript version\n------------------\ngulp-typescript isn't restricted to a single TypeScript version.\nYou can install the latest stable version using `npm install typescript --save-dev` or a nightly `npm install typescript@next --save-dev`.\n\nYou can also use a fork of TypeScript, if it is based on TypeScript 2.x. You can configure this in your gulpfile:\n```javascript\n[...].pipe(ts({\n    typescript: require('my-fork-of-typescript')\n}));\n```\nOr in combination with a `tsconfig` file:\n```javascript\nvar tsProject = ts.createProject('tsconfig.json', {\n    typescript: require('my-form-of-typescript')\n});\n```\n\nSource maps\n----------\ngulp-typescript supports source maps by the usage of the gulp-sourcemaps plugin. It works for both JavaScript and definition (`.d.ts`) files. You don't have to set `sourceMap` or `declarationMap` in your configuration. When you use gulp-sourcemaps, they will be generated automatically.\n\nConfiguring the paths of source maps can be hard. The easiest way to get working source maps is to inline the sources of your TypeScript files in the source maps. This will of course increase the size of the source maps. The following example demonstrates this approach:\n\n```javascript\nvar gulp = require('gulp')\nvar ts = require('gulp-typescript');\nvar sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');\n\ngulp.task('scripts', function() {\n    return gulp.src('lib/*.ts')\n        .pipe(sourcemaps.init()) // This means sourcemaps will be generated\n        .pipe(ts({\n            // ...\n        }))\n        .pipe( ... ) // You can use other plugins that also support gulp-sourcemaps\n        .pipe(sourcemaps.write()) // Now the sourcemaps are added to the .js file\n        .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));\n});\n```\n\nWhen you are not inlining the source content, you should specify the `sourceRoot` property. It can be configured with the following rule:\n\n- If you don't provide the `outDir` option to TypeScript, the `sourceRoot` option of gulp-sourcemaps should be the relative path from the `gulp.dest` path to the source directory (from `gulp.src`)\n- If you set the `outDir` option to the same value as the directory in `gulp.dest`, you should set the `sourceRoot` to `./`.\n- If you set the `outDir` option to a different value, there is no easy rule to configure gulp-sourcemaps. I'd advise to change the value of outDir if possible.\n\nFurthermore you should set `includeContent: false`. Here's an example where `outDir` isn't set:\n```js\ngulp.task('scripts', function() {\n    return gulp.src('lib/*.ts')\n        .pipe(sourcemaps.init())\n        .pipe(ts({\n            // ...\n        }))\n        .pipe(sourcemaps.write('.', { includeContent: false, sourceRoot: '../lib' }))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));\n});\n```\n\nSome examples can be found in [ivogabe/gulp-typescript-sourcemaps-demo](https://github.com/ivogabe/gulp-typescript-sourcemaps-demo).\n\nFor more information, see [gulp-sourcemaps](https://github.com/floridoo/gulp-sourcemaps).\n\nCustom transforms\n-----------------\nYou can pass aditional transforms to the compiler pipeline. We aligned with the interface of [awesome-typescript-loader](https://github.com/s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader). You can specify transforms by setting the `getCustomTransformers` option.\n\nThe option expects a string, pointing at a module that exposes the transforms, or a function that returns the transforms. Its type is `getCustomTransformers: (string | ((program: ts.Program) => ts.CustomTransformers | undefined))`.\n\n```js\nconst styledComponentsTransformer = require('typescript-plugin-styled-components').default;\n\nconst project = ts.createProject('test/customTransformers/tsconfig.json', {\n    getCustomTransformers: () => ({\n        before: [\n            styledComponentsTransformer(),\n        ]\n    });\n});\n```\n\nReporters\n---------\nBy default, errors are logged to the console and the build crashes on compiler errors. In watch mode, the build does not throw, meaning that consequent builds are still ran. Note that gulp 4 is required for this behaviour. If you are still using gulp 3, see  the section \"Gulp 3\" below.\n\nIf you want to change the way that messages are logged to the console (or some other output), you can provide a reporter. You can specify a custom reporter as the second argument of the main function, or as the only argument when using a `tsProject`:\n```javascript\nts(options, reporter);\ntsProject(reporter);\n```\nAvailable reporters are:\n- nullReporter (`ts.reporter.nullReporter()`) - Don't report errors\n- defaultReporter (`ts.reporter.defaultReporter()`) - Report basic errors to the console\n- longReporter (`ts.reporter.longReporter()`) - Extended version of default reporter, intelliJ link functionality + file watcher error highlighting should work using this one\n- fullReporter (`ts.reporter.fullReporter(showFullFilename?: boolean)`) - Show full error messages, with source.\n\nIf you want to build a custom reporter, you take a look at `lib/reporter.ts`, that file declares an interface which a reporter should implement.\n\nGulp 3\n------\nThis plugin works best with gulp 4. If you cannot update to this version, you may experience problems when using incremental compilations with a watcher. A compilation error will namely crash the process, which is desired in a CI environment. Gulp 4 prevents that the process crashes in watch mode. This does not happen in gulp 3, so you will need to handle that manually.\n\nYou should attach an error handler to catch those compilation errors.\n\n```js\ngulp.src(..)\n  .pipe(ts(..))\n  .on('error', () => { /* Ignore compiler errors */})\n  .pipe(gulp.dest(..))\n```\n\nBuild gulp-typescript\n------------\n\n1. Clone this repo\n2. Execute `npm install`\n3. Execute `git submodule update --init` to pull down the TypeScript compiler/services versions used in the test suite.\n4. Ensure the gulp CLI is globally installed (`npm install -g gulp-cli`).\n5. Execute the tests: `gulp`.\n\nThe plugin uses itself to compile. There are 2 build directories, ```release``` and ```release-2```. ```release``` must always contain a working build. ```release-2``` contains the last build. When you run ```gulp compile```, the build will be saved in the ```release-2``` directory. ```gulp test``` will compile the source to ```release-2```, and then it will run some tests. If these tests give no errors, you can run ```gulp release```.

These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\ti. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;\n\n\tii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n\n\tiii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person\'s image or likeness depicted in a Work;\n\n\tiv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n\n\tv. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\n\n\tvi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n\n\tvii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer\'s Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer\'s heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer\'s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer\'s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer\'s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer\'s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n\n\ta. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n\n\tb. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n\n\tc. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person\'s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n\n\td.
